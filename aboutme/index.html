    <h2>Sam</h2>
    <p>Hey, my name is Samuel Apol√¥nio, and I'm 21 years old. I work as a car mechanic, but that's just one of my many passions. I love making music, working out, and building computers in my free time.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Music is my jam, and I enjoy creating new sounds and experimenting with different genres. When I'm not making music, you can find me at the gym, pumping iron and staying fit.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I'm also a bit of a tech geek, and building computers is a hobby that I've been obsessed with since I was a kid. I'm always tinkering with different hardware components, trying to create the ultimate machine.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I believe that programming is the way of the future, and I'm stoked to learn more about it so I can create software and applications that can make a real impact.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I'm excited to see where my college education takes me and how I can use my skills to make a positive difference in the world.</p>
